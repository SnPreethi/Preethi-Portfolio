# MY PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

### HELLO, WORLD! 
This time, I have tried to build something different. From AI models to `<div>` tags, my CPU is now officially overdriven.

<p align=justify>I have spent most of my learning years in the field of AI & ML, and web development is a completely new domain for me. To challenge myself and learn effectively, I decided to dive straight into building a project - my personal portfolio. It was like learning a new langugae, but instead of matrices, I was learning to speak in layouts and animations while figuring out why my `<div>` wouldn't center!!!</p>

## LIVE WEBSITE

Do checkout my portfolio live at : https://preethisn.netlify.app/ 

I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions!

## TECH STACK

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## CHALLENGES FACED

- CSS doing everything except what I wanted
- JavaScript event listeners ghosting me
- The box model making me question reality

<p align=justify>Debugging felt more like a boss fight, styling was an art war, and animations? Let's just say my screen saw things it wasn't ready for. But every bug taught me more than any tutorial ever could. Watching it all finally move? Pure magic.</p>

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
- Add more dynamic and interactive elements
- Improve animations for smoother UI
- Optimize for faster responsiveness
